# HammingTransmitter

This program is a simulated communication channel that takes in an image as a jpg file, introduces error to it, and then uses Hamming code error detection to correct and save the image as a png file. Functions include probabilistic error injection and Hamming code operations such as encoding, error correction, and decoding.
